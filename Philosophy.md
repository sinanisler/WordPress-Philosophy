Freedom
One of the most important aspects of WordPress is the freedom of use that it provides. The enforcement of these freedoms in WordPress is via the General Public License (GPL), which out lines the terms and conditions under which you are allowed to use, modify and distribute WordPress. Part of those licensing requirements include licensing derivative works (themes, plugins, etc.) under the GPL as well, thereby passing on the freedom of use for these derivative works as well.

Obviously there are those who will try to get around these ideals by trying to find loopholes or some how circumvent the intention of the WordPress licensing, which is to ensure freedom of use. We believe that the community as a whole will reward those who focus on supporting these licensing freedoms instead of trying to avoid them.

The most responsible use of WordPress community resources would therefore be put to best use by emphasizing high quality contributions that embrace the freedoms provided by the GPL.
